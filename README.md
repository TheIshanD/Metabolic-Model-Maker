##  The nature of the project:

My project is the Metabolic Model Maker (M3). Its primary purpose is to help researchers investigate intracellular processes to discover quantitative relationships between biological molecules and propose novel mechanisms to affect these processes given the model. Using my project, researchers can adjust the strength, effect, and types of relationships between biological molecules. By providing M3 with qualitative relationships (activation, expression, inhibition, repression, methylation, etc.) between genes, proteins, and structures, the project automatically creates a structure that mimics these processes. Then, after creating a base model for the cell, users can manually shift the strength and effect of these relationships. Within the program, users can simulate how this model, which the user has created, can affect the future makeup of the cell--computing values based on the quantitative values the user has applied to qualitative relationships. Users can then export this model that they have created into a .txt format which is easy to read and parse. Using this exported format, users are then free to use the model for any use they please. For example, they can send it to others, use it in other programs, or use it as data for analysis. Users can also simply plug it back into the M3 and it will reload the biological structure with the quantitative attributes that the model file describes. 

To design M3, I followed a design process that has 3 distinct steps which I would. The first is to outline a project goal. By explicitly writing out and thinking of the next step that could improve my project--whether by automating tasks, optimizing processes, or creating new functionality--I could develop a clearer vision of my next step. The next step I would undergo would be to research tools, modules, and existing techniques I could use to accomplish my project goals to affirm I am using the best possible technology and developing an efficient solution. In this step, I would use the said research tools to attempt to design the very basic functionality and develop simple prototypes to understand how they might function if I choose to use them to scale the product up in the next step. The final step in my design process would be to apply the techniques I had researched and chosen in the second step to accomplish the project goals that I had outlined in the first step. At this point, I would be fleshing out my prototype to develop a functional, detailed product.

M3 addresses issues that are commonly faced by researchers. M3 allows researchers to understand the incredibly complex interactions between biological molecules within cells and how these interactions are affected by different variables such as genetic mutations, environmental factors, and drugs in an organized, simple manner. These interactions are key to understanding cellular metabolism and the underlying causes of disease. Traditional experimental techniques to determine the effects of molecular interactions can provide some insights, but they can be time-consuming, costly, and may not be able to fully capture the complexity of cellular metabolism. There is a lack of quantitative data that establishes the magnitude of these relationships, so generating evidence-based proposals for treatments and models can be incredibly difficult. Once generated, using traditional methods, cross-applying these findings about these relationships into different contexts becomes impossible reducing the impact of the finding on the specific scenarios under which they were found. M3 provides a solution to these problems by being an easy-to-use, resource-efficient, and non-context-dependent tool.

## The Impact:

The Metabolic Model Maker (M3) is an interdisciplinary solution (by combining fields of biology and math) to efficiently determine the quantitative relationships between components of a biological process. By using deep learning concepts, M3 paves the way for new biological modeling solutions using computer science concepts. For example, in the project, each molecule is represented by a neuron in a neural network. There are weights that feed into each neuron, biases each neuron has, and activation functions that transform values. What's truly transformative about this project is that the architecture of the neural network is explicitly defined by the underlying biological processes, optimized for biological representation. Many existing deep-learning-based solutions use unrelated structures to attempt to determine outcomes. Rather, the M3 puts the end-goal focus on determining the weights of the neural network rather than directly trying to predict outcomes. Data is very sparse for a generalized input-output metabolic model: making backpropagation and techniques like SGD ineffective. My model allows the researchers to use M3 to create the weights, biases, and activation functions themselves, given the structure of the process to make more educated hypotheses on metabolic models or potential new drug combinations to fight disease. This is a novel approach as it fundamentally contrasts the traditional, accepted view of the usage of neural networks. As we enter the future, I hope that M3 inspires other and more applications of applying neural networks without specifically training them (automatically at least).

What truly makes my project innovative, however, lies within its fundamental nature of being a cross-application of computer science into biology. While M3’s effects on computer science set a precedent and are a flagship for future, similar applications, current biological system researchers immediately feel the impact of M3. In the current metabolic research world, signaling pathway maps are used for qualitative analysis to develop theories. One possible application of these theories would be to develop drug combinations to fight disease. For example, if gene A and gene B both express gene C which causes bladder cancer, it would be reasonable for a researcher to propose a drug that inhibits both gene A and gene B and begin conducting experimental trials. However, if the researcher got the opportunity to investigate the quantitative relationships between genes (and get numbers on the WEIGHT of gene A and gene B on gene C respectively), they might come to new conclusions--perhaps by finding that gene A has a 100x effect on gene C than gene B does. This could drastically affect how their drug would be initially designed in trials which would then definitely target gene A as more of a threat. Overall, it helps researchers identify potential targets for the development of new therapeutics. 
Another impact is that, by simulating the metabolic changes that occur in disease states, researchers can better understand the underlying causes of these conditions, improving our general knowledge about diseases in general. In fact, M3 doesn’t have to be constricted to disease--it can help generate models for all biological processes from endocytosis to thyroid hormone synthesis to even coronavirus infections. M3 helps researchers generate more accurate models with lower costs and less time spent. 

Currently, I have not yet deployed M3 to the rest of the world--but, I plan on doing so soon. I have plans for how I should go about doing so. First, I want to collaborate with local researchers and healthcare providers. I personally know some local researchers from past projects I have worked on that would greatly benefit from a tool like M3. I could partner with them to investigate metabolic pathways that are relevant within my community--including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. I could also generate models myself using M3. By collecting existing data on states of biological processes, I would be able to generate highly accurate models for these processes which I could then send to other researchers, accelerating the pace of said research. Finally, I could partner with existing biotech companies currently in the industry. This would provide me with access and exposure to other novel approaches to problems and I would be able to improve M3 to tailor to their existing practices. All of these approaches to applying M3 into my community are incredibly impactful by significantly reducing barriers to quantitative biological analysis

## Project Technicalities

There are three layers to The Metabolic Model Maker (M3). First is the GUI layer. Next is the display layer. Lastly, we have the network layer. Each of these layers is represented by an abstraction in my code by putting them into separate python files. Upon running M3, the GUI layer is the first thing the user sees. The GUI layer imports the display layer. In the GUI layer, users must select a KGML file to import before running the simulation. They may choose to generate a model after they close out of the tab. If they do, whatever file name they give the model will be what it shall be saved as. Finally, users can click the import model button which will start a simulation in accordance with what the model describes. This layer was programmed using PySide6.
After running the simulation, users are taken to the simulation or the display layer. In this layer, a simulated model of the KGML file is represented graphically. In this layer, users are able to click on genes/entries and edit the values of numbers. This layer was programmed using PyGame. It is a graphical representation of what is occurring in the final, deepest layer: the network layer.
In the network layer, there are a series of neurons that are each constructed to represent an entry from a KGML file. Each of these neurons follows the activation function hyperbolic_tangent(relu()). Each neuron is also assigned a bias. Each connection between neurons is assigned a weight, initially dependent on the types of relationships prescribed by the KGML file. Essentially, the network layer is a neural network structure that is manually modifiable through the display layer. This layer was programmed through pure python.

Over the course of developing M3, I faced many challenges which have impacted the results of the project in significant ways. One of the biggest such challenges was how I intended on displaying the KMGL file. Initially, I had thought I would try to make a neat graph that had an emphasis on user-friendliness. The issue with this approach was that existing modules to graphically display networks brought users out of the program and provided them with HTML files. Examples of such modules are Dash or NetworkX. These modules also didn’t allow the full customization that I required. From there, I thought about using PyGame. Using PyGame, I would be able to manually create these graphs--and I didn’t have to worry about the structure of the graph colliding with itself visually because the KGML file had already solved that problem! 

Another issue I faced was finding a proper GUI module. I couldn’t use a common, easy-to-implement modern module like tkinter or PySimpleGUI because my operating system and the version of Python I was on creating a bug that made them not function. I couldn’t simply upgrade my Python version because PyGame was no longer compatible. Instead, I relied on older lower-level modules like PySide6 to accomplish the job.

The plans that I had made before jumping into the process were mostly reading up on biological processes and thinking about how I could represent them. For example, I had initially believed that logic circuits would be the best way to represent biological processes, but after understanding the underlying biological processes further, I realized that neural networks better encapsulated the full complexity of the system. One computing plan that I had made but then later scrapped as I dove further into the project was that I thought it would be best to iterate through the KGML file using DFS and then use a topological sort to create the structure in a novel comprehensive way. But then, I realized simply iterating over the connections would be more efficient and the topological sort was unnecessary as the KGML file already provides graphical positions for drawing. I don’t think a single initial specific plan had gotten to the final stage of development without any edits.
